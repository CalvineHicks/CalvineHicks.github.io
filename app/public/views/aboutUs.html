			<p>AT Finder is a search service focussed on helping people with disabilities find affordable assistive technology.  We are a government funded service made possible by the Assistive Technology Act of 2004 P.L. 108-364; H224B030001 and H224B060002.</p>

			<p>Please support AT Finder by filling out one of our surveys!</p>
			<p>Since AT Finder is funded through a grant from the federal government, we are required to report usage data and customer satisfaction data to the federal government. The survey is a way of collecting this data from each individual user and also gives us feedback as to how AT Finder can be improved.</p>
